### **Step 1 : Covariance Matrix Computation**

Covariance measures the strength of joint variability between two or more variables, indicating how much they change in relation to each other. To find the covariance we can use the formula:

> cov(x1,x2) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x1_i-\bar{x1})(x2_i-\bar{x2})}{n-1}   

The value of covariance can be positive, negative, or zeros.

- Positive: As the x1 increases x2 also increases.
- Negative: As the x1 increases x2 also decreases.
- Zeros: No direct relation
